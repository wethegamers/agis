  - Deployed at `http://74.220.19.34` with LoadBalancer access
  - Supports issues, pull requests, stars, forks, releases, and repository events
  - Prevents duplicate notifications by filtering CI/CD events handled by workflows

#### 🔧 Production-Ready CI/CD Pipeline
- **Multi-Stage Deployment**: Automated publish → development → staging → production pipeline
- **Container Registry Integration**: GHCR publishing with automated image tagging
- **Environment-Specific Deployments**: Proper environment isolation and configuration
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration test stage with Discord notifications

#### 🏗️ Kubernetes Infrastructure
- **Webhook Proxy Service**: Production-ready deployment with ConfigMap-based code injection
- **External Secrets Integration**: Vault-backed secret management for Discord webhooks
- **LoadBalancer Services**: External access for GitHub webhook integration
- **Health Monitoring**: Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes

#### 📚 Comprehensive Documentation
- **Deployment Guide**: Complete webhook setup and configuration documentation
- **Setup Scripts**: Automated webhook configuration and testing tools
- **Status Documentation**: Real-time deployment status and troubleshooting guides

### Changed

#### 🔄 CI/CD Architecture Overhaul
- **Notification Strategy**: Migrated from scattered notifications to unified Discord system
- **Webhook Integration**: Centralized GitHub event handling via dedicated proxy service
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper secret management and environment variable handling
- **Deployment Process**: Streamlined multi-environment deployment with status tracking

#### 💻 Development Workflow
- **Branch Strategy**: Optimized for main-branch CI/CD with proper environment promotion

- **Secret Management**: Fixed Discord webhook URL access across Kubernetes namespaces
- **External Access**: Configured LoadBalancer service for reliable GitHub webhook delivery
- **Notification Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate notifications between CI/CD and webhook events

#### 🔧 Infrastructure Improvements
- **Service Discovery**: Fixed external IP allocation and service exposure
- **Container Configuration**: Resolved Python dependency installation in production environment
- **Health Checks**: Proper HTTP endpoint configuration for Kubernetes probes

### Technical Details

#### 🌐 Service Architecture
```
GitHub Repository → GitHub Webhook → Webhook Proxy (K8s) → Discord Channel
                                   ↗ LoadBalancer IP: 74.220.19.34
                                   
CI/CD Pipeline → GitHub Actions → Argo Workflows → Discord Notifications
```

#### 📦 New Components
- `github-discord-webhook-proxy.py` - Python webhook translation service
- `k8s-github-webhook-proxy-configmap.yaml` - Kubernetes deployment manifests
- `setup-github-webhook.sh` - Automated webhook configuration script
- `WEBHOOK_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation

#### 🔗 External Integrations
- **GitHub Webhooks**: Repository events → Discord notifications
- **Discord API**: Rich embed formatting with environment-specific styling
- **Kubernetes LoadBalancer**: External webhook endpoint exposure
- **Vault Secrets**: Secure webhook URL management

### Migration Notes

#### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Webhook Configuration**: GitHub repository webhook must be configured manually
- **Secret Requirements**: Discord webhook URL must be available in Kubernetes secrets
- **Network Requirements**: External LoadBalancer access required for webhook proxy

#### 🚀 Deployment Requirements
1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Must support LoadBalancer services
2. **External Secrets**: Vault integration for Discord webhook URL
3. **GitHub Repository Access**: Admin access required for webhook configuration
4. **Discord Channel**: Webhook URL configured for target Discord channel

### 📋 Setup Checklist
- ✅ Webhook proxy deployed to Kubernetes (`http://74.220.19.34`)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with Discord notifications active
- ✅ Argo workflow Discord integration configured
- ✅ External secrets configured for webhook URLs
- ⏳ **Manual Step Required**: Configure GitHub repository webhook

### 🎯 Next Steps
- Configure GitHub repository webhook at: https://github.com/wethegamers/agis-bot/settings/hooks
- Monitor Discord channel for comprehensive notification coverage
- Test end-to-end integration with repository events
