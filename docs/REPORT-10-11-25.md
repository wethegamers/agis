Based on a comprehensive forensic analysis of the `agis-bot` codebase (via the repomix summary) cross-referenced with your Mastermind Business Strategy (v4.0), here is the deep-dive review.

### Executive Summary
The `agis-bot` is technically mature in its infrastructure (Kubernetes/Agones/Vault integration is excellent) but **operationally immature** in its user-facing economy features.

You have successfully built the *engine* (backend services), but you are missing the *steering wheel* (user commands) for your most critical differentiator: the Guild Economy.

### 🔴 Critical Gaps (Must-Fix Before Launch)

These are features that exist in your `internal/services` (backend logic) but have **zero exposure** to the end-user via Discord commands. If you launch now, these features effectively do not exist for your users.

#### 1. The Guild Interface "Air Gap"
Your business model relies on Guilds to sell high-margin Titan servers.
* **Backend Reality:** `internal/services/guild_treasury.go` has full logic for `CreateGuild`, `DepositToGuild`, `AddMember`.
* **Frontend Reality:** `internal/bot/commands/guild_server_command.go` ONLY has commands to *spend* treasury money (`create`, `terminate`) and view it (`treasury`).
* **THE GAP:** Users have **no way to create a guild, invite members, or deposit money**. You have a vending machine with no coin slot.
* **Missing Commands needed immediately:**
    * `/guild create <name>`
    * `/guild invite <@user>`
    * `/guild join`
    * `/guild deposit <amount>`

#### 2. The Ad Dashboard "MVP Trap"
* **Current State:** `internal/http/server.go` (lines 798-846) serves a raw, unstyled HTML string as your ad dashboard.
* **Business Risk:** This is your primary revenue engine for 85% of users. Presenting a 1995-style HTML page will severely hurt trust and conversion rates. It needs, at minimum, a styled template matching your brand.

#### 3. Missing "Premium" Role Sync
* **Current State:** `internal/services/role_sync.go` only syncs one role type: `VERIFIED_ROLE_ID`.
* **Business Risk:** When a user subscribes via Stripe, they get premium *benefits* in the database, but they don't automatically get a "Premium Member" role in Discord to flaunt their status (a key psychological driver for subscriptions).
* **Fix:** Update `RoleSyncService` to also sync a designated `PREMIUM_ROLE_ID` based on `users.tier`.

### 🟡 Features Needing Refinement (Friction Points)

#### 1. Server Actions Stubbed Out
* **Observation:** In `docs/v1.7.0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, it explicitly states: `POST /api/v1/servers/:id/start - Start server (stub)`.
* **Impact:** Your new REST API cannot actually control servers yet, only list them. This limits the utility of any future web dashboard.

#### 2. Hardcoded "Titan" Logic
* **Observation:** You have excellent dynamic pricing in the database. However, the *logic* for what requires a guild seems partially hardcoded or loosely defined.
* **Refinement:** Ensure the `requires_guild` boolean in your `pricing_config` table is strictly enforced in BOTH individual `create` commands (blocking them) and guild `create` commands (allowing them).

---

### 🗑️ Redundant / Dead Code

* **Legacy Command Stubs:** You have some older command structures or separate files (like `v1_3_commands.go`, `v1_4_5_commands.go`, `v1_6_commands.go`) that might be better consolidated now that feature sets are stabilizing. It works, but it's messy.
* **Manual "Work" Command:** With a robust ad system, the `/work` command (earning tiny amounts of GC manually) becomes low-value noise. Consider deprecating it to focus users entirely on high-value ad watching or subscriptions.

### 🔮 Industry Standard "Missing Criticals"

If you want to compete with established hosts (even premium ones), you are missing these standard API/Bot features:

#### 1. RCON / Console Access (High Importance)
* **Standard:** Every game host allows users to see the live server console and send commands (e.g., `/op user`, `/gamemode creative`).
* **Current Status:** Missing. Users have no way to manage their server internals without you building a custom command for every possible game action.
* **Recommendation:** Implement a secure websocket or streaming API endpoint that proxies to the Agones SDK `ExecuteCommand` or attaches to the pod's stdin/stdout.

#### 2. Real-time Server Metrics for Users
* **Standard:** Users want to see "Why is my server lagging?" (CPU/RAM graphs).
* **Current Status:** You have these metrics internally for *yourself* via Prometheus, but no easy way for a *user* to see them via bot or API.
* **Recommendation:** A `/server stats <name>` command that pulls live CPU/Memory usage from the pod metrics.

#### 3. Automated Mod/Plugin Installer
* **Standard:** One-click install for popular plugins (PaperMC, Oxide for Rust).
* **Current Status:** Users likely have to manually FTP files (if FTP is even exposed? I don't see explicit FTP services in the charts).
* **Recommendation:** This is complex but necessary for retention long-term.

### Summary Roadmap Adjustments

Your immediate engineering focus must shift from "building new backend services" to "exposing existing services to the user."

1.  **P0 (Next 48 Hours):** Implement the missing Guild Discord commands (`create`, `invite`, `deposit`). The backend is ready; just wire up the UI.
2.  **P1 (Next Week):** Style the Ad Dashboard. Do not launch with raw HTML.
3.  **P1 (Next Week):** Implement `PREMIUM_ROLE_ID` sync in `RoleSyncService`.
4.  **P2 (Post-Launch):** RCON/Console access API.
